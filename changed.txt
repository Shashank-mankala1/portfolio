- The purpose of my portfolio is to track my learning and development throughout my undergraduate years.

- My portfolio is a collection and reflection of my experiences to get a clearer picture of my growth.

A CSE undergraduate student with good algorithmic and problem solving skills, a python developer and a technology enthusiast. Looking forward to learn and solve challenging problems to fulfill the goals.


Being aligned with the Intended Learning Outcomess of my program, I hope to improve my critical thinking
 ability. I believe, regardless the field, we need to be able to think critically in terms of 
 evaluating what is observed or expressed. I will apply this to my major study as well as my own
  learning and development at a higher level. I will be reflective on my own development by assessing
   it critically. The reflective judgment will help me to improve in the long run.
